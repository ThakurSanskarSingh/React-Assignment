 This is Weather web application which is built using React via Vite. 
 I had already built similar web app before using raw JS only, this time i have used React
 My main aim was to provide more reusabality to code and divide it into multiplle components
 As directed in the assignment i have tried to follow the same way of writing code
 I hav provided some additional features like
 5 days forecast of weather
 Converting celsius to farhenhieght
I have tried to build organized file structure to provide reusability of code.
